# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
Front-End Development Bootcamp prework study guide for students.

As a Front-End development bootcamp student, I want to keep track of the technologies used to create web applications.
I have built this project in order to make better sense of the subjects studied and to apply what I have learned across all the lessons.
This project helps me centralize the notes I took during studying and makes for a handy reminder.
